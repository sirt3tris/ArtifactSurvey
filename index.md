# Introduction

On this page you will find the outcome of a spontaneous and independent survey contucted on r/Artifact with the goal of exploring how players approach Artifact. Since the launch of the game has not been particularly successful, I was interested in understanding how do people feel when playing the game, how often they play it and what they like/dislike about it. 
I created a survey by adapting two psychological questionnaires that have been previously used to evaluate gaming gaming experience in several contexts: The Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ - IJsselsteijn, de Kort & Poels 2013) and the MEEGA+ Questionnaire (Petri, Gresse von Wangenheim, Borgatto, 2018). I then combined these items with demographic information, such as how often people play the game and which game modality, to contextualize the game evaluation.

# Methods



## Methods
I posted the survey on r/Artifact and invited users who played at least 6h since the launch of the game.
