# Summary
This is the outcome of a spontaneous and independent survey contucted on r/Artifact with the goal of exploring how players approach the game Artifact, how they feel when playing it, and what they like/dislike about it. For this I adapted some items from two psychological questionnaires (The Game Experience Questionnaire - IJsselsteijn, de Kort & Poels 2013; the MEEGA+ Questionnaire - Petri, Gresse von Wangenheim, Borgatto, 2018) and combined them with demographic information, such as how often people play the game and which game modality.
